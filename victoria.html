   <h3>History of Victoria Memorial</h3>
   <p>The reason behind the building of a monument of this grand a scale is indeed an interesting one. This stunning creation is the brainchild of Lord Curzon and was created to commemorate the twenty-fifth-year reign of the Queen over India. The Queen had become the figure head of India after the Revolt of 1857 and successfully ruled over the country until her death in 1901. Lord Curzon wanted that the monument that would be dedicated to her should be stately, spacious and large, with a beautiful garden. In fact, the funds for the construction of the Victoria memorial were raised from the people of India. A sum of 5 lakh rupees was raised, and the result is this awe-striking monument, that is a literal feast for the eyes. King George V and the Prince of Whales laid down the foundation stone for the memorial in 1906, and the memorial was finally opened to the general public in 1921. </p>
   <h3> Architecture of Victoria Memorial</h3>
   <p> The chief architect of the Victoria Memorial is William Emerson, the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He has tastefully lent an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture to the monument, while drawing inspiration from Egyptian, Venetian, Mughal and other Islamic styles at the same time. The 184 feet high building is constructed with Makrana Marble of white colour that was brought all the way from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The vast gardens that surround the monument, and are spread over a sprawling 64 acres, were designed by botanist Sir David Prain and Lord Redesdale.</p>
   <h3> Victoria Memorial Garden</h3>
   <p> The gardens of the Victoria Memorial are home to a myriad of sculptures. A bronze statue of Queen Victoria on a bronze throne welcomes the visitor at the entrance of the memorial, while a walk around the garden reveals other statues like those of Edward VII, Curzon, Hastings and Dalhousie. Allegorical sculptures like Motherhood, Architecture, Learning and Justice can also be found here. Spread over 64 acres, the gardens are presently maintained by 21 gardeners and are a favourite destination for morning walkers.</p>
