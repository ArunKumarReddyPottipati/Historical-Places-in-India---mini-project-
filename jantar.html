   <h3>History of Jantar Mantar</h3>
   <p> Sawai Jai Singh was an accomplished scholar himself and was commissioned the task of confirming and rectifying the current data available on the movement of celestial bodies by Emperor Muhammad Shah. Jai Singh wanted to refine the ancient Islamic zij tables so that the exact hour of the day could be determined. Eventually, he wanted to define a precise calendar and make accurate astrological predictions for both individual and social benefit. To achieve this, he decided to build Jantar Mantar in the year 1718. He made extensive studies on the astronomical principles of Hindu, European, Islamic and Persian civilizations and built five different observatories across North India. The construction of Jaipur's Jantar Mantar took place in the period between 1727 and 1733 and was renovated time and again. The instruments here were built such that they covered a very wide range of cosmological applications which further accelerated developments in this field. It got featured on UNESCO's list of World Heritage in the year 2010 and has been an even greater attraction ever since.</p>
   <h3>Architecture of Jantar Mantar</h3>
   <p> The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is a collection of different architectural and astronomical instruments. It has 19 major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, ascertaining the declinations of planets, determining celestial altitudes and tracking stars in their orbits. This attraction is spread over an area of 18,700 meters and some of the instruments here are the largest of their kind. Sawai Jai Singh II decided to build the observatory instruments with stone and marble because the stone can withstand extreme weather conditions much better as compared to metal, which has a tendency to wear and tear easily. Some of these instruments were conceptualized and designed by the Raja himself. On the other hand, a few of the instruments here are built from copper and still work with startling accuracy. In terms of its area, Jaipur's Jantar Mantar is the largest one as compared to its other counterparts in the north of India.</p>
