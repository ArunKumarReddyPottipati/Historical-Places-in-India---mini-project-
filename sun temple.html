   <h3>History of Sun Temple</h3>
   <p>Construction of the Sun Temple is credited to Narsimhadeva, a ruler of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. It is assumed that the temple was built to commemorate the victory over Tughral Tughan Khan in 1255 CE. A common local legend, bound to be heard from your travel guide is the presence of a massive magnetic rod at the centre of the temple which interfered with the compasses of travelling ships causing wrecks which ultimately led to its collapse. The wheels of the Sun Temple are actually sundials which tell the time accurately. It was also known as 'Black Pagoda' because of its colour. The Konark Temple, as seen today was merely an entrance to the main temple back then which has fallen now.</p>
   <p>Fascicle No 7 of Madala Panji (The Official Record Book of the Jagannath Temple) of Mukunda Deva (1551-1568 AD) records the cause of demolition as a result of invasion by Muslim Invader named Kala-Pahad (who is also incidentally claimed to be a Hindu Renegade) in 1568 AD, when he removed key structural supports of the monument and damaged the idols but the theory doesn't hold much ground. A later entry of the Madala Panji, in Fascicle No 6 of Raja Narasimha Deva, son of Raja Purusottama Deva (1621-1647), it becomes clear that the temple collapsed. The Fascicle notes that "In the 9th Anka of the reign of this Raja, the big lion, the Gaja Simha, on the eastern side of the Konark Temple fell down towards the east, together with the Eastern Temple Wall. At this time the hands of puja image were broken, whereupon the entire country fell into great affliction." The entry further notes the shifting of the Chalanti Prateema (The portable images) to the Jagannath Temple at Puri.</p>
   <h3>Architecture of Sun Temple</h3>
   <p>The Sun Temple built in a traditional Kalinga style of architecture has been made in the form of a massive chariot of the Sun God with twelve pairs of sumptuously engraved stone wheels, pulled by a set of seven horses. The temple is brilliantly slanted to the east so the first rays of sunrise forays the main entrance. The entrance is manned by two huge lions on either side, both crushing a man and an elephant beneath. Erotica, monsters, beasts, warriors, and animals are carved on the outer walls all around the temple. Sculptures are vividly similar to the ones at Khajuraho Temple in Madhya Pradesh. The main sanctum (Vimana) which was a massive seventy meters tall fell back in 1837 due to weak soil and the huge weight of the structure. An audience hall about 30 meters high still stands and is the last of the main surviving structures.
</p>
<p>Archeologists have also discovered a couple of other temples from 11th century around the main temple. One of them is known as Mayadevi Temple dedicated to one of the Sun god's wife and the other is assumed to be dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Konark SUn Temple has an abundance of erotic sculptures known as 'Mithuna' sculptures. There are no concrete explanations for the presence of these sculptures on the outer walls of the temple. A common legend is that the sculptures were built after the Kalinga War to promote love making due to the huge loss of lives. The surviving structures on present-day apart from the entrance are the 'Nata Mandir' (Dancing Hall) and 'Bhoga Mandapa' (Dining hall). The Nata Mandir refers to the 'Devdasis' tradition when dancers lived inside the temple complex dedicating their entire life to dance forms like Odissi and Bharatnatyam. Sculptures, erotic carvings on walls and images of wars, animals, and warriors are found everywhere. Konark Sun Temple is the third link of the state's golden triangle with Jagannath Puri Temple as the first link and Bhubaneswar as the second.</p>
<p>Originally built on the sea bank, it is now a considerable distance away from the seashore. A Navgraha Temple (Nine Planets Temple) is also located just outside the Sun Temple; it contains a huge black coloured slab with idols of the nine planets made of chlorite stones. The slab was initially kept above the main doorway but is now kept inside the Navgraha Temple. Waking through the temple structure one is likely to feel like they are lost in the pages of history.</p>
