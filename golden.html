   <h3>History of Golden Temple</h3>
   <p> The land for the Golden Temple was donated by the Mughal emperor Akbar on which construction began in 1574. The foundation was overseen by the fourth and fifth Sikh Gurus, and the construction was completed in 1601. It has been restored and embellished continuously over the years. In the 19th century, the inverted lotus-shaped dome was inlaid with 100 kgs of gold and decorative marble. This took place under the patronage of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who was a legendary warrior king fondly remembered by the Sikh community.
</p>
<p> In 1984, the then Prime Minister of India, ordered an attack on the armed Sikh militants hiding inside the Golden Temple premises. In the fight that ensued, over 500 people were killed, and Sikhs all over the world were enraged by this sacrilege of their holy site. The Sikh community did not allow the central government to undertake the repair of the damage caused to the temple, undertaking the work themselves. The temple has been substantially built since then, but the incident remains fresh in the memory of the locals.</p>
<h3>Architecture of Golden Temple</h3>
<p> 1. Akal Takht and Teja Singh Samundri Hall: Akal Takht, meaning “The throne of the Timeless (God)” stands right in front of the main sanctum. Established by Guru Hargobind after his father Guru Arjan, the place came to be known for its ceremonial, spiritual as well as secular affairs. While the Akal Takht in the complex of the Golden Temple is the primary seat and chief authority of Sikhism, there are 4 more Takhts spread across Anandpur, Patna, Nanded and Talwandi Sabo, all of which are major pilgrimage sites for Sikhism.</p>
<p> 2. Clock Tower: While the clock tower did not exist in the original construction of the temple, the Clock Tower built by the British stands in the place of the “lost palace”. In the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the British demolished a part of the building and added a clock tower instead. Designed by John Gordon, the Clock Tower was built in the year 1874 but was later demolished by the Sikhs, 70 years later. Presently, there is a new entrance to the temple which has a clock to its north and a museum on its first floor, but people still refer to it as ghanta ghar deori.</p>
<p> 3. Ber Trees: Originally, the complex of the Golden Temple was open and housed numerous trees around the pool. Now, the temple premises has a two storey courtyard with four entrances and 3 Ber (jujube) trees. The first one is called the Ber Baba Buddha and is located to the right of the ghanta ghar deori. The tree gets its name from Baba Buddha who sat under this tree while supervising the construction of the first temple and the pool. The second tree called the Laachi Ber is believed to be the tree under which Guru Arjan took rest while the construction of the temple was taking place. The third tree, Dukh Bhanjani Bher is located across the pool, on the other side of the sanctum. According to the Sikh tradition, a Sikh was cured of his leprosy after he took a dip in the waters of the temple pool, giving the tree the label of “suffering remover”. There is a small gurudwara under this tree.</p>
<p> 4. Sikh History Museums: The main ghanta ghar deori houses a Sikh museum on its first floor which displays the various paintings of the Gurus as well as the martyrs. Items such as swords, kartar, combs, chakkars stored in the museum depict the Sikh history in all its glory.</p>
<h3>Festivals Celebrated at Golden Temple</h3>
<p> One of the most important festivals celebrated at the Golden Temple is Vaisakhi in the second week of April (mostly the 13th April). This festival is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the Khalsa. The other festivals observed with great religious piety are the birthday of Sikh founder Guru Nanak, the birth anniversary of Guru Ram Das, martyrdom day of Guru Teg Bahadur, etc. The Harmandir Sahib is brightly illuminated with lights and diyas on Diwali along with the fireworks display. The temple is visited by most Sikhs at least once during their lifetime.</p>

<p> The Golden Temple can be reached by local transport such as auto and cycle rickshaws which are the cheapest and most convenient mode of transportation. It also has car rental companies from where you can hire a car and reach the temple. The Golden Temple Trust also arranges free bus services from the Amritsar Railway Station.</p>
