   <h3>History of Mysore Palace</h3>
   <p>The Mysore Palace has a rich history attested to it. It used to be the residence of the royal Wadiyar family of Mysore from 1350 to 1950, for almost 600 years. During its lifetime, the palace had been built and rebuilt many times. In 1897, the then ruler of Mysore, Krishna Rajendra Wadiyar IV, ordered the restoration and reconstruction of the palace after a wooden palace was destroyed by fire at a wedding ceremony. Lord Henry Irwin, the British architect, was commissioned to replace the older palace which had gotten burnt during a fire in 1897. The palace's construction was completed in 1912 and cost an exorbitant amount of INR 41,47,913 at the time.

<p>In 1940, several renovations were made in the palace structure, which included the Public Darbar Hall.The descendants of the royal family continue to reside in one portion of the Mysore Palace, while most of the palace is now state-owned and converted into a museum. It's one of the most famous and well-known attractions in India attracting more than six million tourists annually.</p>
<h3>Architecture Of Mysore Palace</h3>

It is a three-storeyed stone palace with marble domes and has a 145 ft tall five-storeyed tower. There is a large garden surrounding the palace. Entry to the palace is through "Gombe Thotti" or Doll's Pavillion with traditional dolls of different times displayed and a wooden elephant decorated with gold. The kingdom's motto, "never be terrified" is written in Sanskrit on the entrance gate and the arch.
